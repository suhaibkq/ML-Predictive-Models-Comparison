# ML-Predictive-Models-Comparison
The objective of this project was to develop various machine learning models that predict the outcome of U.S. visa applications as "Certified or Denied" using applicant and job-related data. The goal is to help EasyVisa (third party service provider) prioritize strong applications, guide clients more effectively, and improve operational efficiency.
